# AUTOCORRECT-FEATURE-USING-NLP
1.Objective:
The aim of this project is to design and implement an auto-correction system that can automatically correct misspelled or incorrectly typed words in textual input. This system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and probabilistic modeling to generate the most likely correction for any given input based on context and frequency.
