#Project Process

-A large English corpus is used as the reference vocabulary.

-Text was cleaned by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing into individual words.

-Word frequencies were computed to estimate the probability of each word, which aids in ranking candidate corrections.

- 4 possible ways of how we can fix a typing error is implemented such as-

1.Deletion of letter

2.Switching Letter

3.Replace Letter

4.Insert new Letter

-We applied lemmatization before checking the vocabulary to improve accuracy.

-A unigram model was created using the word frequency dictionary.Each candidate correctionâ€™s probability was calculated as P(word) = Count(word) / Total Words.The word with the highest probability among generated candidates is chosen as the best correction.

-The system accepts a misspelled word and returns the best correction.
It handles:
Known words (returns the word itself)
Unknown words (generates possible candidates and selects the most probable one)
