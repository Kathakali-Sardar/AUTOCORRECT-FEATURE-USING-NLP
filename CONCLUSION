#CONCLUSION-

This project successfully implemented a rule-based and probabilistic auto-correction system using NLP techniques.The model is effective for single-word corrections.

Learns from input data → calculates word probabilities.

Uses NLP-based word similarity → finds the closest words.

Provides the best suggestions → ranks words by frequency.

Handles common spelling mistakes → via deletion, insertion, replacement, and switching.

For further steps, we can work on the High level auto-corrector system which uses the large amount of dataset and works more efficiently.
